# quizgame
A Quiz Game made in C++.

But now I think I will add the questions and answers in a separate file and then through
the file pointers read and make questions objects by using loop until end of file is reached.

And also add the highscore feature maybe by storing the name of player and the highscore in a file.

And again I maybe will think of other possible features to add.
